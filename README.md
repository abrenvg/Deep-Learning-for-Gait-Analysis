Gait involves complex systems, making it particularly susceptible to alterations in a wide range of medical specialities, including neurological, orthopedic, cardiac, pulmonary, and even oncological conditions. In this assignment, you will investigate the association between gait and other conditions.

Tasks

1. Develop your own neural network to predict the pathology and pathology key among the ortho and neuro patients in the dataset. 

2. You will have to design a methodology to model this rigorously, using a case-control strategy, where the cases are ortho and neuro and health patients are controls. Note the class imbalance between all three. 

3. Describe and document all steps taken, including cleaning, pre-processing, visualization etc. 

4. Describe your architecture, intialization and training strategy carefully. What architecture did you choose, what layers, how many epochs, hyperparameter tuning etc. 

5. Describe the accuracy of the model, along with extracted features.
